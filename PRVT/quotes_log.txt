[2025-02-24 16:00:02] "But equal treatment in an unequal society could still foster inequality. Because black men were disproportionately incarcerated and black women disproportionately evicted, uniformly denying housing to applicants with recent criminal or eviction records still had an incommensurate impact on African Americans." - Matthew Desmond, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City
[2025-02-24 18:00:03] "Often I have heard the taunt that suffragists are women who have failed to find any normal outlet for their emotions, and are therefore soured and disappointed beings. This is probably not true of any suffragist, and it is most certainly not true of me. My home life and relations have been as nearly ideal as possible in this imperfect world." - Emmeline Pankhurst
[2025-02-25 10:00:03] "I've heard fate talked of. It's not a word I use. I think we make our own choices. I think how we live our lives is our own doing, and we cannot fully hope on dreams and stars. But dreams and stars can guide us, perhaps. And the heart's voice is a strong one. Always is.Your heart's voice is your true voice. It is easy to ignore it, for sometimes it says what we'd rather it did not - and it is so hard to risk the things we have. But what life are we living, if we don't live by our hearts? Not a true one. And the person living it is not the true you." - Susan  Fletcher, Corrag
[2025-02-25 12:00:03] "Feeling awful is physiological you say.God I hate you, I say. Yes you can find the neurons for feeling awful. Do you think you can find the neurons for the fact I hate you?" - Alice Notley, In the Pines
[2025-02-25 14:00:02] "I have come with this message: since our gods and our aspirations are no longer anything but scientific, why shouldn't our loves be so too?" - Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, Tomorrow's Eve

[2025-02-25 18:00:03] "It is possible to become discouraged about the injustice we see everywhere. But God did not promise us that the world would be humane and just. He gives us the gift of life and allows us to choose the way we will use our limited time on earth. It is an awesome opportunity." - César Chávez
[2025-02-25 20:00:02] "Right at this moment, I only want silence. I believe that the end of life is silence in the love people have for you. I've actually been running through what people have said about the end. Religion says that the end is one thing, because it serves their purpose. But great thinkers alike haven't always agreed. Shakespeare knew how to say it better than anyone else. Hamlet says 'The rest is silence.' And when you think of the noises of everyday life, you realize how particularly desirable that is. Silence." - Vincent Price
[2025-02-26 10:00:02] "As a way of getting in touch with my originsevery night I set the alarm clockfor the time I was born so that waking upbecomes a historical reenactment and the first thing I do" - David Berman

[2025-02-26 14:00:03] "I doubt it's a strictly factual account, but these attitudes are deeply imbedded.Which means that our only hope of changing them, of ending the wrecks, lies not in stopping or even changing the Internet -- even with the best blocking functions, report-abuse functions, real-name transparency protocols, and twenty-four-hour moderation in the world, hate (to quite Jurassic Park) finds a way -- but in changing ourselves, and our definitions of womanhood. We have to stop believing that when a woman does something we don't like, we are qualified and entitled to punish her, violate her, or ruin her life. We have to change our ideas of what a "good" woman, or a "likable" woman, or simply a "woman who can leave her house without fearing for her life because she is a woman," can be." - Sady Doyle, Trainwreck: The Women We Love to Hate, Mock, and Fear... and Why
[2025-02-26 16:00:03] "No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness.If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind." - Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet
[2025-02-26 18:00:03] "You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life." - Albert Camus
[2025-02-27 10:00:02] "A destructive thought process exists within all of us, and we are plagued to varying degrees by an internal dialogue that is harmful, restrictive, and at its ultimate extreme, self-destructive." - Lisa Firestone
[2025-02-27 12:00:03] "For a while, Criticism travels side by side with the Work, then Criticism vanishes and it's the Readers who keep pace. The journey may be long or short." - Roberto Bolaño, The Savage Detectives

[2025-02-28 12:00:02] "as long as I can still dream, I will dream of you." - Cassandra Clare
[2025-02-28 14:00:02] "We plan our lives according to a dream that came to us in our childhood, and we find that life alters our plans. And yet, at the end, from a rare height, we also see that our dream was our fate. It's just that providence had other ideas as to how we would get there. Destiny plans a different route, or turns the dream around, as if it were a riddle, and fulfills the dream in ways we couldn't have expected." - Ben Okri
[2025-02-28 16:00:11] "Regardless of the situation, don’t let the bastards win … and have no regrets … for it will be a good day!-Richard Wakinyan (Martian Fleet Commander)" - R.G. Risch, Beyond Mars: Crimson Fleet
[2025-02-28 18:00:02] "The law (of least effort) asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature." - Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow
[2025-03-01 10:00:02] "God don't call the qualified, He qualifies the called" - D WordSmith
[2025-03-01 12:00:02] "Why couldn't Rachel be a little more specific about the type of person she was? Goodness knew; if she were a hippie I'd talk to her about her drug experiences, the zodiac, tarot cards. If she were left-wing I'd look miserable, hate Greece, and eat baked beans straight from the tin. If she were the sporty type I'd play her at... chess and backgammon and things." - Martin Amis, The Rachel Papers
[2025-03-01 14:00:01] "The practice of that which is ethically best—what we call goodness or virtue—involves a course of conduct which, in all respects, is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence. In place of ruthless self-assertion it demands self-restraint; in place of thrusting aside, or treading down, all competitors, it requires that the individual shall not merely respect, but shall help his fellows... It repudiates the gladiatorial theory of existence... Laws and moral precepts are directed to the end of curbing the cosmic process." - Thomas Henry Huxley, Evolution and Ethics: And Other Essays
[2025-03-01 16:00:03] "I need the thing that happens when your brain shuts off and your heart turns on." - Elizabeth Wurtzel, Prozac Nation
[2025-03-01 18:00:03] "It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with we cease to see. The writer shakes up the familiar scene  and  as if by magic  we see a new meaning in it." - Anais Nin
[2025-03-01 20:00:02] "The change starts when you start watching a video. You don't see it, you don't feel it but it starts at this moment, just by reading a complicated book or watching a film you again change... It's a fact!" - Deyth Banger
[2025-03-03 10:00:02] "But one of the things I learned is that when you fight for something you believe in and you tell the truth and you do your best, you can always hold your head up high and no one can take that away from you." - Vanessa Kerry
[2025-03-03 12:00:02] "People have wanted to narrate since first we banged rocks together & wondered about fire. There’ll be tellings as long as there are any of us here, until the stars disappear one by one like turned-out lights." - China Miéville, Railsea

[2025-03-03 16:00:02] "Sibyl, what do you want?”“I want to live,” the Sibyl said, and her voice rang rich and full. “I want to keep on living forever and watching heroes and fools and knights go up and down, into the world and out. I want to keep being myself and mind the work that minds me. Work is not always a hard thing that looms over your years. Sometimes, work is the gift of the world to the wanting." - Catherynne M. Valente, The Girl Who Fell Beneath Fairyland and Led the Revels There

[2025-03-03 22:00:02] "When we fully understand the brevity of life, its fleeting joys and unavoidable pains; when we accept the facts that all men and women are approaching an inevitable doom: the consciousness of it should make us more kindly and considerate of each other. This feeling should make men and women use their best efforts to help their fellow travelers on the road, to make the path brighter and easier as we journey on. It should bring a closer kinship, a better understanding, and a deeper sympathy for the wayfarers who must live a common life and die a common death." - Clarence Darrow, The Essential Words and Writings of Clarence Darrow
[2025-03-04 00:00:02] "So long as we are driven by the need to make up for our needs; by the restless sense that we are not yet fully assured of our place in the world and our hold on its swarming phenomena; so long as there is more to be discovered and made, more to grasp for and make real, we must go on inventing ourselves." - David Malouf, The Happy Life: The Search for Contentment in the Modern World
[2025-03-04 02:00:02] "They preach the supremacy of the state, declare its omnipotence over individual man and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the Earth. They are the focus of evil in the modern world.... So, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride, the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil." - Ronald Reagan
[2025-03-04 04:00:02] "The journey may be long for those who accept the challenge. And, if you endure the storms along the way the rewards for doing so are that much greater." - Michael A. Contés II
[2025-03-04 06:00:01] "He says, "I would walk around the township and I could point them out, which girls had been abused. You could see it in them. There's a luminosity to incest. The taboo is so strong and the damage so great. Luminosity--do you understand? It travels across oceans and down generations. They shine with it." - Emma Brockes, She Left Me the Gun: My Mother's Life Before Me

[2025-03-04 12:00:02] "I can't afford to gamble."His breath came out in a hiss, but he tightened his grip around her."So we'll take it slow then," he said. "I won't push you beyond what you want, Sam. But fair warning: I will push you. When this happens it'll be on your terms, because you want it as much as I do."

[2025-03-05 10:00:05] "I think of something quite different from a snapshot. I know of a lot of poems, some very fine ones, that are like snapshots, but I'm more interested in poetry that is like an endless film, long stories, things that weave together many different strands, like a big piece of cloth, not like a photograph." - Robert Bringhurst
[2025-03-05 12:00:03] "Beauty is not the reflection of your image, but the reflection of the seer's inner vision." - Debasish Mridha
[2025-03-05 14:00:04] "For example, if you think you are a certain way as a person and that is just who you are and you don't have the power to change, that will become true for you. Whatever image, thoughts or words you continuously play in your conscious mind, your soul (subconscious) will believe. So think the best. Suggest the best." - Machel Shull

[2025-03-06 10:00:03] "Your mistake is that you've concluded life is short, so you treat it as if it's precious, like a pretty little princess. Bullshit! Everyone's life is short. Quit feeling sorry for yourself. Fuck it. Treat it like a cheap hooker. Ask crazy shit from it, and you'll get more out of life than you could have ever wanted, imagined, or deserved." - Ty Roth, So Shelly
[2025-03-06 12:00:02] "Elliott was disarmingly bright, according to everyone who knew him, an avid reader of Dostoevsky, Kafka, Beckett, Stendhal, Freud, the Buddha, all of whom destabilized notions of identity. I think he knew how little we know about who we are. The idea comes through in lyrics. “I don’t know who I am,” he says simply; at times he wishes he were no one. He’s a stickman shooting blanks at emptiness, living with “one dimension dead.” He’s an invisible man with a see-through mind. He’s a junkyard full of false starts. He’s a ghost-writer, feeling hollow." - William Todd Schultz, Torment Saint: The Life of Elliott Smith

[2025-03-07 10:00:03] "By bringing together people who share interests, no matter their location or time zone, social media has the potential to transform the workplace into an environment where learning is as natural as it is powerful." - Marcia Conner, The New Social Learning: A Guide to Transforming Organizations Through Social Media
[2025-03-07 12:00:03] "Individuality is but another act of segregation. We need instead learn the process of Individuation. One is to know thyself merely to be a single brick within the wall of mass creation and group consciousness." - Tyler Hebert
[2025-03-07 14:00:02] "My own writing has perhaps more of an American flavor than a British one, but that's because the stories I've so far written have needed it. 'Empire State,' 'Seven Wonders' and 'The Age Atomic' are all very place-centric, where the setting itself is almost a character. But there is a universality to story that isn't just limited to science fiction." - Adam Christopher
[2025-03-07 16:00:02] "Words can't fix my life.Words can't give me a family.Words can't do jack.You may be a teacher, Ms. Leone, but face it: You don't know squat." - Wendelin Van Draanen, Runaway

[2025-03-08 14:00:02] "Dogs are our link to Paradise. They don't know evil or jealousy or discontent. To sit with a dog on a hillside on a glorious afternoon is to be back in Eden, where doing nothing was not boring — it was peace." - Milan Kundera
[2025-03-08 16:00:02] "We deny more than we confess. We hide more than we reveal. We assume because it makes us feel exposed if we have to ask. It's easier to say "I feel nothing" than to admit "I feel something." It takes no courage to say, "I hate you" but it takes a great deal of moxie to declare its opposite. Masks are elaborate and everyone has one. It takes a while to get to know people. This doesn't make them special, it makes them like everyone else. Sometimes our hearts scream yes while our heads say run; and only one can be obeyed." - Donna Lynn Hope
[2025-03-08 18:00:02] "If it doesn't make sense, it's usually not true." - Judy Sheindlin
[2025-03-10 10:00:02] "I love to draw—pencil, ink pen—I love art. When I go on tour and visit museums in Holland, Germany or England—you know those huge paintings?—I’m just amazed. You don’t think a painter could do something like that. I can look at a piece of sculpture or a painting and totally lose myself in it." - Michael James Jackson
[2025-03-10 12:00:02] "A young woman stood before the railing, speaking to the reception clerk. Her slender body seemed out of all scale in relation to a normal human body; its lines were so long, so fragile, so exaggerated that she looked like a stylized drawing of a woman and made the correct proportions of a normal being appear heavy and awkward beside her. She wore a plain gray suit; the contrast between its tailored severity and her appearance was deliberately exorbitant—and strangely elegant.She let the finger tips of one hand rest on the railing, a narrow hand ending the straight imperious line of her arm. She had gray eyes that were not ovals, but two long, rectangular cuts edged by parallel lines of lashes; she had an air of cold serenity and an exquisitely vicious mouth. Her face, her pale gold hair, her suit seemed to have no color, but only a hint, just on the verge of the reality of color, making the full reality seem vulgar. Keating stood still, because he understood for the first time what it was that artists spoke about when they spoke of beauty." - Ayn Rand
